- Hi my name is Adrian, I am a third year life science student studying at the University of Toronto.
- I am currently majoring in Human Biology and Cell Molecular Biology, trying to get into med school :/
- I've never been interested in coding but had a change of heart recently when I was doing something related to data science and healthcare in one of my courses
- Now I am trying to self-learn coding with Python first and later on to other languages if time permits 
- If there are any good tips n tricks pls lmk it would be much appreciated
